            two areas of crash prevention as well as post-crash response.
            In the past decade, over 1 million people have been killed in road crashes in India. Close to 6 million have been left seriously injured or permanently disabled.[2] Road crashes are the single biggest killer of young people, aged 15â€“45 years in India. An alarming number of families have fallen into poverty after losing their primary breadwinners to road crashes. According to the
            12th Report of the erstwhile Planning Commission of India, road crashes lead to an annual economic loss equivalent to 3% of India's annual GDP.</p>
